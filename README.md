## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I mainly learned and tried to implement semantic html as another user had suggested i should in my previous project. I also learned how to use rem units instead of px for easier page-wide adjustmentents.

### Continued development

I think I need to find a better solution for centering items than just making flexboxes.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools | HTML Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - This site taught me everything I needed about semantic elements. It never dissapoints

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css/difference-between-em-and-rem-units-in-css/) - I will probably keep going back to this page to revise what em and rem mean and how they differ from measuring everythin in px.
